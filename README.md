# PAS-Reduced-Footprint-AWS

# Overview

It is primarily meant for Cyberark partners, SE and Support team to minimize charges of running PAS deployment on AWS.

We provide you with the necessary tools and scripts to deploy CyberArk's Privileged Access Security (PAS) solution on Amazon Web Services (AWS) with one click.

The different templates provide you with the flexibility of deploying CyberArk PAS to support your architecture (hybrid, multi-cloud, all in the cloud and etc.).

There are 2 steps to the entire PAS deployment on AWS-
1. First step is to automatically deploy the network using either PAS-network-environment-NAT.json or PAS-network-enviroment-PrivateLink.json template.
2. Second step is to then deploy the Full-PAS-Deployment_ReducedResource.yaml template

For more details, you can watch the Youtube video we put together.
